# Spring Testing Lab 2

## Instructions

Create a new endpoint that integrates with a different API:

1. The API you will integrate with is an API that can give you information on
   many cryptocurrencies.
2. The URL you will need is: http://api.coincap.io/v2/assets/bitcoin - the API
   is free to use and does not require authentication.
3. Create an endpoint that uses this API to return the current cost of 1 Bitcoin.
4. Make sure each method is unit test and integration tested as appropriate.
